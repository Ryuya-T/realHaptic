abstract = {Piezoelectric actuators with high resolution, high stiffness and fast frequency response are widely assembled in micropositioning applications. The tracking accuracy of piezoelectric actuators under open-loop control is seriously limited due to inherent hysteresis nonlinearity in their response to an applied voltage. In a closed-loop control system without sufficient phase margin, the hysteresis will cause instability. This paper presents a computer-based tracking control approach based on polynomial approximation to reduce the hysteresis effect. Because of hysteresis, the expansion of a piezoelectric actuator is dependent not only upon the current value of input voltage but also upon its input history. In this paper, a new parameter called turning voltage is introduced. It was found experimentally that the shapes of hysteresis curve are decided by the value of turning voltage and by whether the piezoelectric actuator is expanding or contracting. The presented approach reduced an inherent hysteresis of 10{\%} to 3{\%} and provided an accuracy of 3{\%} within the working range of 0-4$\mu$m under open-loop control. A nonlinear feedback controller based on predicted hysteresis curve compensated the difference between expanding directions in deformation velocity.},

abstract = {The six axis F/T sensor is a primary component for the robotic technologies, but its high unit cost hampers the popularization to the robotic applications. In this paper, we present a six-axis force-torque capacitive sensor based on dielectric elastomer. Dielectric elastomer is compressed and deformed with external forces acting on it. Its deformation results in the variation of capacitance, which can be used as a kind of capacitive sensing scheme. The proposed sensor consists of plastic structure and dielectric elastomer capacitors. Since it takes a simple structure, it is possible to fabricate by using a plastic molding process, which results in extremely lower cost than existing off-the-shelf products. We present the basic structure and design of the sensor with the explanation of its working principle. A fabrication method dedicated to the sensor is developed and finally, a prototype will be demonstrated with calibration procedures.},

@article{Chuah2014,
abstract = {This paper presents a new force sensor design approach that maps the local sampling of pressure inside a composite polymeric footpad to forces in three axes, designed for running robots. Conventional multiaxis force sensors made of heavy metallic materials tend to be too bulky and heavy to be fitted in the feet of legged robots, and vulnerable to inertial noise upon high acceleration. To satisfy the requirements for high speed running, which include mitigating high impact forces, protecting the sensors from ground collision, and enhancing traction, these stiff sensors should be paired with additional layers of durable, soft materials; but this also degrades the integrity of the foot structure. The proposed foot sensor is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of an array of barometric pressure sensors completely embedded in a protective polyurethane rubber layer. This composite architecture allows the layers to provide compliance and traction for foot collision while the deformation and the sampled pressure distribution of the structure can be mapped into three axis force measurement. Normal and shear forces can be measured upon contact with the ground, which causes the footpad to deform and change the readings of the individual pressure sensors in the array. A one-time training process using an artificial neural network is all that is necessary to relate the normal and shear forces with the multiaxis foot sensor output. The results show that the sensor can predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 300 N with a root mean squared error of 0.66{\%} and up to 80 N in the X-and Y-axis. The experiment results demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a lightweight, low cost, yet robust footpad sensor suitable for use in legged robots undergoing ground locomotion. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

This paper presents an overview of MEMS/micro-F/M sensors. This field is critical to many biomedical applications, materials science, industrial automation, dimension measurements in microcomponents, and nanomanufacturing applications, and has attracted great activity in the past 15-25 years. The evaluation of different F/M sensing principles, recent advances in various designs, and their significance and limitations are analyzed through specific examples. Furthermore, current challenges and new area for future applications of micro-F/M sensing technology have been identified.},

For instance, tightening a knot requires pulling on the ends, flattening an article of clothing requires smoothing out wrinkles, and erasing a whiteboard requires applying downward pressure. We present a method for learning force-based manipulation skills from demonstrations. Our approach uses non-rigid registration to compute a warping function that transforms both the end-effector poses and forces in each demonstration into the current scene, based on the configuration of the object. Our method then uses the variation between the demonstrations to extract a single trajectory, along with time-varying feedback gains that determine how much to match poses or forces. This results in a learned variable-impedance control strategy that trades off force and position errors, providing for the right level of compliance that applies the necessary forces at each stage of the motion.

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sults reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bod- ies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8{\%} accu- racy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70{\%} relative im- provement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Autonomous learning of object manipulation skills can enable robots to acquire rich behavioral repertoires that scale to the variety of objects found in the real world. However, current motion skill learning methods typically restrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting its expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently developed policy search method [1] and use it to learn a range of dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations, without using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set of trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted time-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single control policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to run on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample count and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire fast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn robust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy airplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto tight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.},

In many cases, force/torque sensors or tactile sensors on robots do not contact with environment directly, but they contact through end-effectors or grasped objects. So robots have to estimate actual contact forces through insensitive objects. However, estimating multiple contact forces through insensitive objects is the ill-posed problem. This paper proposes a method of estimating contact forces on three points separately with a six-axis force/torque sensor on an end-effector. We clarified that components of the contact forces normal to the plane defined by the three contact points can be found uniquely by static equilibrium of force and moment, and tangential components of the contact forces can also be determined by using some kind of additional algorithm. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by experimental results.},

However, selection of the controllers for tool use and how to design them remains indeterminate. This paper addresses the task of drawing a circle with a compass as an example of tool use. This task mandates to deal with complex contact at multiple points and needs to educe functions of the compass to draw a circle accurately. This paper demonstrates the implementation and corresponding method of compass controller design. The method of designing the controller for the compass entails decomposing the usage of the compass into semantic units and subsequently defining a coordinate system and fabricating the controller via mapping of the semantic units to axes. The implementation of a controller for compass use indicates that the ability of the compass to accurately draw a circle is educed via mechanical constraints of the compass. We validated the implemented controller by drawing a circle and comparing the result to a circle drawn using a pencil.},

However, the trajectory planning for dynamic manipulation is a difficult issue due to dynamic constraint. Trajectory deformation considering dynamic constraint after original trajectories are generated is necessary for the issue. To realize such deformation methods, we introduce on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, which can convert a time series to another time series. This paper proposes a trajectory deformation method with seq2seq models deforming trajectories to satisfy dynamic constraint. Users can obtain trajectories for dynamic manipulation by designing outlines of motion and inputting them to the proposed seq2seq model. In addition, this paper proposes a learning curriculum that does not need labeled dataset. Only mathematical representation of constraint and unlabeled trajectories are necessary.We implement a seq2seq model by the proposed method to a robot turning over pancakes and confirm the validity by a simulation and an experiment.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excel-lent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Fi-nally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

abstract = {Manipulating objects is one of the main topics in robotics. There exist various types of manipulation called nonprehensile manipulation which do not involve grasping. This paper proposes a method based on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, which deforms a given trajectory to another trajectory accomplishing nonprehensile manipulation. As the first step to realize it, this paper proposes a method of training seq2seq models to learn identity mapping. By chunking trajectories, seq2seq models can learn to memorize given trajectories and reproduce them while avoiding the gradient exploding problem and increase of memory usage. The results of this study provide useful knowledge for development of neural models on learning trajectory deformation in nonprehensile manipulation.},

abstract = {In order for robots to work in our daily lives, they often have to contact with their environment. They need to control both position and force, while it is a difficult issue when the environment varies. One approach for this issue is to deform trajectories with respect to the environmental variation. Since there may occur various environment fluctuation, we need a general-purpose method for contact motion deformation. We focus on neural networks. This paper proposes a method of deforming trajectories of position and force by using sequence-to-sequence models. The proposed model can adapt to various requirements by only designing a differentiable loss function. The algorithms of deformation are obtained by the proposed model with unsupervised learning. This paper shows an example of implementation in one-dimensional contact motion. This paper shows that the proposed method can reproduce the timing of contact even when the positions of contact objects change.},
